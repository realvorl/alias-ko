## Motivation

I want a memorable / simple `URL` to a file that I download, it contains `aliases` that the community over at [KO's YT Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@DigitalMetal) can colaborate on, by contributing their favourite aliases.

## How it works

1. open a PR on this repository & with your favourite `alias(es)`   
1. wait for the next release ( every two weeks - will be automated by GitHub actions )
1. use this URL: to download the aliases.
1. (future feature) run the script(s) to set them up for your `user profile` / `.*rc` file
